## Going back in time...

> In 1993, the first web browser with a user interface called Mosaic was realsed
>
> In 1994, the lead developers of Mosaic founded a company called Netscape and released a more polished brower called Netscape Navigator
>
> Web pages could only be static and there was no interactivity after a page was loaded
>
> In 1995, Netscape created a new scriping language called JavaScript
>
> The name purely for marketing purpose as Java was the hot new language back then.

## The advent of Microsoft

> In 1995, Microsoft debuted their browser Internet Explorer ( this led to a brower war with Netscape )
>
> Microsoft realised that JavaScript fundamentally changed the user experience of the web and wanted the same for internet explorer
>
> But there was no specification for them follow
>
> In 1996, Microsoft reverse-engineered the Navigator interpreter to create its own scripting language called JScript ( JScript filled the same use case as JavaScript but it's implementation was different )
>
> The differences made it difficult for developers to make their websites work well in both brower ( in fact the two implementations were so different that best viewed in Netscape)
>
> 'Best viewed in Netscape' and 'Best viewed in Internet Explorer' badges became common for most companies who's couldn't afford to build for both implementations

## Ecma international

> In Nov 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International
>
> It's an industry association dedicated to the standardization of information and communication systems
>
> Netscape wanted a standard specification that all brower vendor could conform to as it would help keep other implementation consistent across browers
>
> For each new specification Ecma provides a standard specification and a committee
>
> In case of JavaScript, the standard is called ECMA-262 and the committee that works on ECMA-262 is called Technical Committee 39 ( TC39 )
>
> Ecma however decided to use the term 'ECMAScript' to talk about the official language
>
> The reason for this is because Oracle (Who accquired Microsystem) owns the trademark for the term 'JavaScript'
>
> ECMAScript refers to the standard language whereas JavaScript is what we use in practice and build on top of ECMAScript

> ES2015 also known as ES6 is the version that provides what we call Modern JavaScript feature and has become a prerequitsite for developing with JavaScript

## ECMAScript Summary

- ECMA-262 is the language specification
- ECMAScript is the language that implements ECMA-262
- JavaScript is basically ECMAScript at its core but build on top of that
